The most useful things I have learned/discovered in this course:

NSURLSession (link: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/Articles/UsingNSURLSession.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013509-SW1)

JSONSerialization
	A class to convert bytes of JSON data into objects
	(link: https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/jsonserialization)

Curly braces in postman -> indicative of JSON obj -> like dict in Swift
Square brackets in postman -> indicative of JSON array -> like Swift array

What I learned on
Day 1: 
making a request, deserializing JSON
