Coded an iOS app as part of Udacity's [iOS Networking with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-networking-with-swift--ud421) class that I am taking as review/prep from MHacks9. 

UI was already given, I wrote code to make an image request to Flickr's API and deserialize the return JSON object and set the image and title by selecting a random photo from Flickr's sleeping in the library gallery. 

Followed course videos, read documentation whenever I came across something new or something that I had taken for granted earlier, wrote code, documented it.

Total time spent: slightly more than 3 hours 

The most useful things I have learned/discovered in this course:

[NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/Articles/UsingNSURLSession.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013509-SW1)

[JSONSerialization](link: https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/jsonserialization)
	A class to convert bytes of JSON data into objects

Better understanding of Postman:
-Curly braces in postman -> indicative of JSON obj -> like dict in Swift
-Square brackets in postman -> indicative of JSON array -> like Swift array

What I learned/relearned on
Day 1: 
making a request and deserializing JSON
